  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle-aged woman with advanced AIDS and ESRD on hemodialysis presented with three days of worsening left groin pain, warmth, swelling, and a \"hard bump\" at her left femoral tunneled dialysis catheter, with subjective fevers and chills but initially stable vital signs. Examination showed a very tender, warm indurated area near the catheter, and initial labs revealed chronic anemia (Hgb ~8 g/dL), leukopenia (WBC ~3–4 K/uL), and ESRD-range creatinine with low phosphate and potassium. She had already received ceftazidime and vancomycin at dialysis. The left femoral tunneled catheter was removed, and catheter tip and wound cultures grew MRSA; one blood culture also grew MRSA, while subsequent surveillance blood cultures remained negative, confirming MRSA catheter infection with bacteremia. She was treated with IV vancomycin dosed after hemodialysis, with levels monitored and a planned three-week course. After a line holiday, a right common femoral tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed, but TEE showed the catheter traversing a small secundum ASD into the left atrium with a small mobile echodensity on the tip consistent with thrombus; she was anticoagulated with a heparin infusion for 48 hours, after which repeat TEE showed resolution of the mass, and the catheter was exchanged for a shorter line with the tip in the upper IVC. She developed antibiotic-associated C. difficile colitis confirmed by positive stool PCR and was treated with a 14-day course of oral metronidazole. Nephrology managed her ESRD, holding sevelamer for hypophosphatemia while continuing cinacalcet, nephrocaps, epoetin, and doxercalciferol with dialysis. Given her very low CD4 count and high viral load, she was restarted on ART (abacavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine) while continuing TMP-SMX and azithromycin prophylaxis. Her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remained in sinus rhythm; long-term anticoagulation was recommended but deferred due to adherence concerns, and she continued aspirin alone. By discharge she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with a clean right femoral catheter site, improving diarrhea, and stable chronic cytopenias, and she was discharged home with services to continue hemodialysis, post-dialysis vancomycin, metronidazole, and ART.",
