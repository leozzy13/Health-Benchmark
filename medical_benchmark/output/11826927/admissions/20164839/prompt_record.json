Initial ED vitals showed hypotension that improved with IV fluids; she received empiric piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin due to concern for sepsis in an immunocompromised host, but chest radiograph was clear and blood cultures remained negative, so antibiotics were discontinued. Her history revealed that pregabalin (Lyrica) had been started two days prior for chronic right V1 post-herpetic neuralgia, with a prior similar intolerance to gabapentin. Given the temporal association and lack of infectious source, her lightheadedness and weakness were attributed to a medication side effect of pregabalin, exacerbated by ESRD and post-dialysis hypotension. Lyrica was stopped, and her symptoms improved. She continued thrice-weekly hemodialysis in hospital, with management of hyperkalemia (K 6.5 mEq/L) and uremia, and received cinacalcet, sevelamer, doxercalciferol, and heparin per dialysis protocol. Her chronic AIDS prophylaxis with azithromycin and TMP-SMX was continued, while full antiretroviral therapy was deferred to outpatient management.

She also restarted ART.    \\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES: \\n==============\\n# MRSA Femoral Catheter Infection/Bacteremia: She presented with \\nleft groin pain, swelling, pustular drainage at left femoral HD \\ncatheter site. Femoral catheter pulled after HD on day of \\nadmission.  MRSA grew from blood culture (x1), wound culture, HD \\ncatheter tip culture.  She was treated with vancomycin IV (also \\nreceived ceftazidime and gentamicin doses x1 ___ ED).  No further \\ngrowth on surveillance blood cultures.  HD tunneled line \\nreplaced after 3 day line holiday.  TEE done given staph \\nbacetermia to eval for endocarditis, which showed HD catheter \\ntip traversing ASD into left atrium with small mass at catheter \\ntip (? thrombus).  TEE showed resolution of mass 48hours later.  \\nCatheter replaced again, however tip unfortunately not sent for \\ncutlure.  She will continue treatment for MRSA bacteremia  with \\nVancomycin dosed after HD (MWF) for 3 weeks, ending ___.  \\n\\n# Femoral Catheter placement & ? thrombus:  TEE ___ showed that \\nHD catheter crossed ASD to left atrium with possible thrombus at \\ntip. She was anticoagulated with heparin gtt for 48 hours when \\nrepeat TEE showed resolution of this mass.  Catheter was removed \\nand replaced (not actually sent for culture).  Per d/w \\nCardiology, long-term systemic anticoagulation recommended, \\nespecially since she has underlying PAF and ESRD.  However, pt \\nis poor candidate for anticoagulation with Coumadin due to \\ncompliance and she also refused Coumadin.  ___ was d/w her \\nPCP/ID Specialist (Dr. ___ and nephrologist (Dr. \\n___ who were ___ agreement that Coumadin would be \\nunrealistic at this point ___ time.\\n\\n# Mild-moderate Cdiff: She had copious watery BMs 24 hours after \\nantibiotics given on day infected catheter line was pulled.  \\nMost likely culprit was ceftazadime.  Cdiff PCR positive.  She \\nwas treated with Flagyl x14 days, last day of treatment is \\n___.  \\n\\n# ESRD: She is anuric, on HD.  Her left tunneled HD line was \\ninfected and pulled.  Line resited at right femoral. She \\ncontinues HD MWF with Vanco administered after HD until ___.  \\nShe was seen by renal who recommended holding sevelamer given \\nlow phosphate levels.  She continued nephrocaps and cinacalcet.\\n\\n# AIDS: (CD4 22, VL 304,373 on ___ She was restarted on ART \\nafter discussion of goals of care.  Per her PCP ___ \\nwas started on emtricitabine, abacavir, ritonavir and boosted \\natazanavir.  She was also continued on Bactrim and Azithromycin \\nprophylaxis.  \\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\\n===============\\n# Paroxysmal A.
