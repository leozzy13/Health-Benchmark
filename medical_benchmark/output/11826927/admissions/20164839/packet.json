There is a catheter \ncoursing from the IVC across the septal defect into the left \natrium (patient had a tunnelled hemodialysis catheter placed day \nprior to study which terminated ___ the right atrium by report). \nThere is left to right flow around this catheter (see example \nclips 36, 37, 66, and 88). There appears to be a small, mobile \nechodensity on the catheter tip seen ___ the LA (see clips 64 and \n77) that likely represents thrombus (thrombus most likely given \nthat the catheter was inserted <24 hours ago). The left \nventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple \natheroma ___ the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on \nthe aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \nTrivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial \neffusion.\nIMPRESSION: Secundum atrial septal defect with a catheter \ncoursing from the IVC across the defect into the left atrium. \nPossible small thrombus on the catheter tip. No 2D \nechocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Normal biventricular \nsystolic function.  \n\nTEE: ___\nCatheter again seen traversing a small ASD from the right atrium \nto left atrium. No evidence of thrombus on the catheter tip.  \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the \nmobile echodensity seen on the catheter tip is no longer \nvisualized. Other findings are similar. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with PMH of advanced AIDS (CD4 22, VL 304,373 on ___, \nnot on HAART), ESRD on HD, who presented with left groin pain, \nwarmth, swelling at site of her femoral dialysis catheter site, \nand was found to have MRSA catheter infection and bacteremia.  \nCourse complicated by 1) HD catheter placement into left atrium \nwith ? thrombus requiring anticoagulation and catheter \nreplacement 2) cdiff. She also restarted ART.    \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n==============\n# MRSA Femoral Catheter Infection/Bacteremia: She presented with \nleft groin pain, swelling, pustular drainage at left femoral HD \ncatheter site. Femoral catheter pulled after HD on day of \nadmission.  MRSA grew from blood culture (x1), wound culture, HD \ncatheter tip culture.  She was treated with vancomycin IV (also \nreceived ceftazidime and gentamicin doses x1 ___ ED).  No further \ngrowth on surveillance blood cultures.  HD tunneled line \nreplaced after 3 day line holiday.  TEE done given staph \nbacetermia to eval for endocarditis, which showed HD catheter \ntip traversing ASD into left atrium with small mass at catheter \ntip (? thrombus).  TEE showed resolution of mass 48hours later.  \nCatheter replaced again, however tip unfortunately not sent for \ncutlure.  She will continue treatment for MRSA bacteremia  with \nVancomycin dosed after HD (MWF) for 3 weeks, ending ___.  \n\n# Femoral Catheter placement & ? thrombus:  TEE ___ showed that \nHD catheter crossed ASD to left atrium with possible thrombus at \ntip. She was anticoagulated with heparin gtt for 48 hours when \nrepeat TEE showed resolution of this mass.  Catheter was removed \nand replaced (not actually sent for culture).  Per d/w \nCardiology, long-term systemic anticoagulation recommended, \nespecially since she has underlying PAF and ESRD.  However, pt \nis poor candidate for anticoagulation with Coumadin due to \ncompliance and she also refused Coumadin.  ___ was d/w her \nPCP/ID Specialist (Dr. ___ and nephrologist (Dr. \n___ who were ___ agreement that Coumadin would be \nunrealistic at this point ___ time.\n\n# Mild-moderate Cdiff: She had copious watery BMs 24 hours after \nantibiotics given on day infected catheter line was pulled.  \nMost likely culprit was ceftazadime.  Cdiff PCR positive.  She \nwas treated with Flagyl x14 days, last day of treatment is \n___.  \n\n# ESRD: She is anuric, on HD.  Her left tunneled HD line was \ninfected and pulled.  Line resited at right femoral. She \ncontinues HD MWF with Vanco administered after HD until ___.  \nShe was seen by renal who recommended holding sevelamer given \nlow phosphate levels.  She continued nephrocaps and cinacalcet.\n\n# AIDS: (CD4 22, VL 304,373 on ___ She was restarted on ART \nafter discussion of goals of care.  Per her PCP ___ \nwas started on emtricitabine, abacavir, ritonavir and boosted \natazanavir.  She was also continued on Bactrim and Azithromycin \nprophylaxis.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Paroxysmal A. Fib: she remained ___ sinus rhythm during this \nadmission, CHADS2=0.\nShe was seen by cardiology who recommended long term systemic \nanticoagulation and beta-blocker for her atrial fibrillation, \nhowever given her poor compliance this was not started.  \n\n# Right V1 Post-Herpetic Neuralgia/Headache: stable, she \ncontinued low-dose duloxetine.   \n\n# Depressed Mood: stable.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n-She will need to continue Vancomycin dosed with HD (MWF) \naccording to trough level until ___.\n-She will continue flagyl po for treatment of c diff through \n___\n-She is restarting HAART\n-Can consider adding betablocker ___ future given pAF\n-Full code\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

As there is no option for IJ lines, the line\nhad to be placed in the right common femoral vein.\n\nOPERATORS:  Dr. ___ (fellow) and Dr. ___ (attending)\nperformed the procedure.\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Placement of right common femoral tunneled hemodialysis\nline.\n\nMEDICATION:  Sedation was achieved by providing divided doses of 1 mg of\nmidazolam.  Further pain management was provided by giving divided doses of\n0.6 mg of Dilaudid.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. \nThe patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the\nimaging table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed as per ___ protocol.\n\nAccess to the right common femoral vein was obtained with ultrasound guidance\nand use of the micropuncture technique.  ___ wire was advanced\ninto the right atrium and appropriate measurements taken for the line\nselection.\n\nAttention was now turned to creation of a subcutaneous tunnel.  Subsequent to\nadditional local anesthesia, a 1-cm skin incision was made inferior and\nlateral to the venotomy site.  After providing generous lidocaine/epinephrine\nanesthesia along the anticipated tunnel, a 15-cm tip-to-cuff hemodialysis\ncatheter was tunneled from the incision to the venotomy site with aid of a\nmetal tunneling device.  The venotomy tract was dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12,\nand 14 ___ dilators.  Finally, a peel-away sheath was passed over the wire.\nThe wire and inner cannula were removed and the catheter was passed through\nthe peel-away sheath.  The peel-away sheath was peeled off while the catheter\nwas pushed into the right atrium.  This was confirmed with fluoroscopy,\ndemonstrating the catheter tip in the right atrium.  Both lumens withdrew\nblood and flushed easily.  The catheter was secured with 0 silk sutures.  The\nvenotomy site was closed with ___ Vicryl subcuticular stitches.  Dry sterile\ndressings were applied.  No immediate post-procedure complications were noted.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated placement of 50-cm tip-to-cuff right common femoral\nvein tunneled hemodialysis catheter.  The tip is located in the right atrium\nand the catheter is ready for use.\n",

Questionable thrombus at catheter tip on initial US, now status post\nanticoagulation with no thrombus appreciable on TOE.  Removal and exchange for\na shorter catheter requested.\n\nOPERATORS:  Dr. ___ (fellow) and Dr. ___ (attending)\nperformed the procedure.\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Exchange of right common femoral vein tunneled\nhemodialysis catheter for a shorter line.\n\nMEDICATION:  Moderate sedation was achieved by providing divided doses of 1.5\nmg of Dilaudid and 4 mg of midazolam.\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. \nThe patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the\nimaging table.  A preprocedure timeout was performed as per ___ protocol. A\ntrans esophageal echo performed on the morning of the procedure did not\ndemonstate pericatheter thrombus.The procedure was performed under full\nheparin anticoagulation.\n\nInitial scout image redemonstrated the indwelling tunneled right common\nfemoral vein line with the catheter tip projecting over the right atrium. \nThere was no evidence of interval dislocation or migration.  The sutures of\nthe line were cut and the latter then carefully withdrawn into the IVC. \nSubsequently, a stiff Glidewire was inserted through one of the line lumina\nand the latter then exchanged for a 36 cm HD catheter via the existing tract. \nIn the setting of anticoagulation, an 0 silk pursestring was placed around the\ntract to act as apursedtring to aid hemostasis.  The catheter was further\nsecured by 0 silk sutures and a Tegaderm device.  Both lumina flushed and\naspirated easily.The line was primed with heparin as per protocol\n\nAn orientating neurological exam following the procedure was unremarkable.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated exchange of a 50cm right common femoral tunneled\nhemodialysis catheter for a shorter 36cm 15.5F dual lumen HD catheter via the\nexisting access.  The catheter tip is now in the upper IVC and the line is\nready for use.\n",
