Borderline tachy, \nborderline hypotensive. Elevated lactate and +BCx but not \nparticularly aggressive bacteria. It seems BPs low at baseline \nbut sepsis cannot be ruled out but seems low likelihood at this \ntime. If sepsis, line most likely source. No urine output at \nbaseline but seems to be mentating well with no other have signs \nof end organ dysfunction.  Also possible is hypovolemia with \nrecent dialsysis. ___ nephrologist was contacted and baseline \nbps was reported to be SBP 80-90s. Her hypotension was felt to \nbe related to large volume loss with recent dialysis. Lactate \nnormalized with administration of 500cc NS bolus.

Next HD session is \n___ and would recommend reconsideration of small volume \nremoval given symptomatic BP with aggressive volume removal.\n.\n# +Positive BCx: Coag neg staph likely from line. Has no fever \nor leukocytosis. No urine to culture. CXR clear. Serial blood \ncultures obtained and NGTD at time of discharge.
