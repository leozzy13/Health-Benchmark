  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle-aged woman with HIV, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via a left subclavian catheter, atrial fibrillation, and trigeminal neuralgia was admitted from the emergency department to the ICU for evaluation of hypotension in the setting of a positive blood culture from her dialysis unit showing coagulase-negative staphylococcus, likely catheter-related. She was hemodynamically borderline but consistent with her low baseline blood pressure, afebrile, and without clear source of sepsis; chest X-ray showed no acute pulmonary process. Initial labs showed ESRD-level azotemia, mild hyperkalemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, and normal lactate. She received cautious IV fluids with improvement in lactate, and was treated with IV vancomycin, with a plan to continue dosing via hemodialysis for a total of about two weeks. During the stay she developed significant hyperkalemia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, managed with potassium-lowering therapy and IV then oral diltiazem, with subsequent normalization of potassium and rate control. Repeat blood cultures showed no growth, and she remained clinically stable. She was discharged home with services, to continue vancomycin at dialysis, resume and adhere to her antiretroviral and prophylactic regimens, and follow closely with nephrology, HIV/ID, and primary care.",
