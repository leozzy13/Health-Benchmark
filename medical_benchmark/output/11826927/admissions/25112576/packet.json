Exuberant calcification of falx \nand tentorium likely related to ESRD. \n  \nTTE ___:\nConclusions  \nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \nnormal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow \nobstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There is no ventricular \nseptal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified. \nPreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. \nNo structural valvular abnormality. No resting or inducible LVOT \nobstruction.\n \nRUQ u/s ___: pending at time of discharge\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPt is a ___ yo female with HIV on HAART (followed at ___, \nESRD on HD since ___ (unclear etiology), was headed to see Dr. \n___ HD felt faint, SOB, and diaphoretic. Pt was \nadmitted and monitored on telemetry without events. She remained \nafebrile and normotensive with negative orthostatics. TTE was \nnormal. She had cortisol stim testing, which was negative for \nadrenal insufficiency. She was found to be hypercalcemic of \nunclear etiology, improved after HD. Given nausea, she had \nLFT's, which were normal, and RUQ u/s that was pending at the \ntime of discharge. She was discharged with follow-up with PCP \nand ___.\n\n# Presyncope, hypotension: Likely ___ fluid removal from HD vs. \nadrenal insufficiency. Infectious etiology much less likely. BP \nhas been systolic ___ during the admission. Orthostatics \nnegative. TTE completely normal. She was monitored on telemetry \ninitially with no arrhythmias seen. Blood cultures were sent \nfrom peripheral and HD line, which were pending at the time of \ndischarge. Cortisol resulted at 13.2. ___ stim testing showed \nappropriate response, and no evidence of adrenal insufficiency. \nHer diltiazem was held. She was started on Midrodrine. Pt was \nsymptomatically improved and discharged with close follow-up.\n  \n# SOB, fatigue: DDx afib/other arrhythmia vs. periardial \neffusion vs. deconditioning vs. infection vs. chronic PE's. Pt \nremained in sinus rhythm here with no events on tele. TTE \ncompletely normal. Thought that it could be also be more of a \nsense of overall fatigue associated with hypercalcemia (see \nbelow). Sarcoid considered, though CXR without adenopathy or \nother findings. She was symptomatically improved on discharge.\n \n# Nausea, emesis: Possibly ___ hypercalcemia as discussed below \nvs. medication effect. Pt was treated with zofran and prn \ncompazine. LFT's were checked and normal. RUQ u/s was done and \nread pending at time of discharge. She said that she always has \nnausea with her HAART medication. She was symptomatically \nimproved and tolerating a diet. \n   \n# Headache: Pt had new worsening headache on left side of her \nhead. DDx included migraine vs. tension vs. neuropathic pain vs. \ncaffeine withdrawal. Other possibility is side effect of HAART, \nas the onset of these headaches correlates with initiation of \nHAART. Given new and worsening headache, CT was done which \ndemonstrated calcifications but otherwise wnl. Her pain was \ntreated and she improved. \nShe will follow-up with her PCP for further management, with \nconsideration of triptan medications if HA's c/w migraines.\n \n# Hypercalcemia: Ca checked HOD#1 at 12.7, with ionized calcium \nelevated at 1.45. DDx included tertiary hyperparathyroidism vs. \nAI vs. lytic etiology. Reassuring that Alk phos is normal. PTH \nelevated to 268, though challenging to interpret in setting of \nESRD. As above, ___ stim testing was normal. Vitamin D levels \nwere sent, PTHrP were pending at time of discharge. She had \ncalcium removed with HD. She was continued on the same dose of \nSensipar.\n    \n# HIV: Reportedly, last CD4 94, 250,000VL in ___. Seen at \n___ for her care. Pt states that she has been taking her \nmedications, though she cannot state which ones. Med rec'd with \npharmacy. Continued Viread 300mg ___, lamivudine 50mg daily, \nritonivir 100mg daily, Reyataz 300mg daily. Continued Bactrim \nppx DS 1 tab MWF.\n\n# ESRD on HD: Etiology unclear. MWF dialysis. Pt had HD session \nhere. She was continued on ___, and Sensipar. She was \nstarted on Nephrocaps. She will f/u with Dr. ___ as \noutpatient. \n\n# Leg pain: concerning for PVD. ABI's were ordered, but unable \nto be done over the weekend. Recommend ABI's as outpatient for \nfurther assessment.\n  \n# Atrial fibrillation: Documented on history, but in SR here. \nPresumably this is why she was on the Diltiazem. Diltiazem was \ndiscontinued during this admission given hypotension.\n  \n# chronic right-sided headaches due to prior Trigeminal \nNeuralgia vs. Shingles: Documented as both in OMR. Continued \nvalacyclovir and erythromycin eye drops. Considered Tegretol for \ntrigeminal neuralgia but held off for now. \n\n# Thrombocytopenia: Likely related to HIV. Baseline platelets \n___ during last admission. Plts 146 on admission, increased \nand remained stable. Platelets were 166 on day of discharge.\n  \n# Macrocytosis: on folate replacement. Levels checked during \nlast admission wnl. Continued folic acid. \n  \nTRANSITIONAL CARE:\n1. CODE: FULL\n2. CONTACT: Sister ___ ___\n3.

You \nwere admitted with low blood pressure and shortness of breath. \nYour low pressure resolved while you were on the floors. For \nyour shortness of breath, we checked an echocardiogram of your \nheart, which was completely normal. We started you on a new \nmedication to help with low blood pressure.\nWe also got a CT scan of your head given you continued to have \nheadaches, this showed calcification but was otherwise normal. \nYou should discuss with your doctors ___ that may \nhelp for these headaches.\nYou had dialysis during this admission; however, your blood \npressure was again low and no fluid was removed.\nWe found that your calcium level was high here. This calcium was \npulled off with dialysis. We also did a special test to see if \nyour adrenals were working properly. This test was normal.\nYou were given some medication to help with nausea.\n\nThe following medications were changed during this admission:\n- STOP Diltiazem (Cardizem) 30mg by mouth four times per day\n(This may have been contributing to your low blood pressure)\n- STOP Percocet (to avoid taking too much Tylenol)\n\n- START Oxycodone 5mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain \n**This medication can cause drowsiness so avoid this with \ndriving or doing heavy activity\n- START Nephrocaps 1 tablet by mouth daily\n- START Midodrine 5mg by mouth once daily (this is to help with \nthe low blood pressure)\n- START Prochloperazine 10mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed \nfor nausea\n\nPlease continue to take the other medications you were taking \nprior to this admission.\n\nWe also recommend that you get a study to assess your arteries \n(called ABI's), a special ultrasound test, as an outpatient to \nassess for vascular disease. This may in part explain the leg \npain that you were describing.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

Pancreas is only partially\nvisualized due to overlying bowel gas.\n\nThere are innumerable bilateral renal cysts, likely related to hemodialysis. \nThe spleen measures 11 cm. There is a 1.4 cm hyperechoic splenic lesion,\nlikely representing hemangioma.  No right upper quadrant ascites.  Incidental\nnote is made of a small accessory spleen measuring 1.6 cm.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No acute process of the abdomen and pelvis.\n2.  Innumerable bilateral renal cysts.\n",
