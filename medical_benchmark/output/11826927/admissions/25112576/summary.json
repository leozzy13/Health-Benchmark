  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle-aged woman with HIV on HAART, end-stage renal disease on thrice-weekly hemodialysis, prior trigeminal neuralgia/postherpetic neuralgia, and a history of atrial fibrillation was admitted from the emergency department for presyncope, shortness of breath, and hypotension noted while en route to her nephrology appointment. Initial evaluation showed low but stable blood pressure with normal oxygenation, a normal EKG, and a chest X-ray without acute pulmonary process. She was monitored on telemetry without arrhythmias, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular systolic function and no structural cause of syncope. Laboratory studies revealed significant hypercalcemia (total calcium up to 12.7 mg/dL with elevated ionized calcium), elevated PTH in the setting of ESRD, and chronic macrocytosis with mild leukopenia and stable platelets. She underwent hemodialysis with no ultrafiltration, which improved her calcium and renal indices while avoiding further hypotension. A cosyntropin stimulation test demonstrated adequate adrenal reserve, ruling out adrenal insufficiency. CT head for new left-sided headaches showed no acute intracranial process, and abdominal ultrasound for nausea showed no acute hepatobiliary pathology but innumerable bilateral renal cysts. Blood cultures remained negative, and she stayed afebrile. Her presyncope and hypotension were attributed to dialysis-related volume shifts and medication effects; diltiazem was discontinued, and midodrine was initiated to support blood pressure. Nausea improved with antiemetics, and headaches were managed symptomatically. She was discharged home in stable condition, ambulatory and hemodynamically at her low baseline, with continued HAART and dialysis-related medications, new midodrine and prochlorperazine, and instructions for outpatient follow-up including vascular studies for leg pain.",
