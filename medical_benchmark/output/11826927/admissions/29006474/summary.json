  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle‑aged woman with ESRD on hemodialysis and advanced HIV/AIDS presented with several days of progressive right lower extremity swelling after recent placement of a right femoral tunneled hemodialysis catheter, following removal of an infected left femoral catheter for MRSA on a prior admission. In the ED she was hemodynamically stable, with labs notable for chronic anemia (Hgb ~8 g/dL, Hct mid‑20s), leukopenia (WBC ~4 K/uL), hyperkalemia (K ~5.5 mEq/L), and markedly elevated creatinine (~7.3–7.9 mg/dL) and BUN (~53–59 mg/dL) consistent with ESRD. Duplex ultrasound of the right leg showed no DVT and a patent right common femoral vein with the dialysis catheter entering it, but could not assess the more proximal catheter course. CT pelvis with contrast demonstrated marked right leg edema and the tunneled catheter occupying most of the right external iliac vein, limiting direct visualization of thrombus but with other pelvic veins patent. Given her symptoms, imaging limitations, and history of catheter‑associated thrombus across a secundum ASD on the prior admission, she was treated for presumed catheter‑associated DVT with an IV heparin infusion titrated to markedly elevated PTTs and bridged to warfarin, with INR rising into the therapeutic range (up to ~3.0) by discharge. Her right leg edema improved after the first in‑house dialysis and resolved completely by discharge. During the stay she developed right‑eye conjunctivitis with periorbital swelling and purulent discharge; ophthalmology initiated polymyxin/bacitracin ophthalmic ointment and a 7‑day course of valacyclovir, and HSV/VZV DFA and cultures from skin lesions were negative. Her eye symptoms nearly resolved by discharge. Nephrology continued thrice‑weekly hemodialysis with epoetin, ferric gluconate, doxercalciferol, cinacalcet (at a reduced dose), sevelamer, and nephrocaps. She remained on her antiretroviral regimen (abacavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, emtricitabine) and opportunistic infection prophylaxis (TMP‑SMX, azithromycin). By discharge she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with resolved leg edema, near‑resolved conjunctivitis, stable chronic cytopenias, and therapeutic anticoagulation, and she was discharged home with services, on warfarin 6 mg daily with plans for INR monitoring via her dialysis unit.",
