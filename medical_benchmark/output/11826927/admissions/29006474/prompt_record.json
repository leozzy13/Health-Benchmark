CT Pelvis w/ contrast did \\nnot visualize any clot, but evaluation of the vein around the \\nline was limited. The decision was made to treat for a presumed \\nDVT. A heparin drip was begun and continued until she had two \\ntherapeutic INRs on Warfarin. Her edema largely resolved after \\nher first in-house dialysis session, and completely resolved by \\ndischarge. \\n\\n#Conjunctivitis:\\nDuring her stay, she also developed some periorbital swelling of \\nthe right eye with some purulent material sticking the eye shut \\nin the mornings. Ophtho saw her and started polymyxin/bacitracin \\nointment, as well as a course of valacyclovir given her past \\nhistory of herpes ophthalmicus in the R V1 distribution. She has \\nsome open lesions on her forehead, but these were chronic from \\nthe patient scratching herself due to chronic itch. HSV/VZV DFA \\nand culture were performed on one of lesions as well, and were \\nnegative. On this treatment, her eye symptoms nearly completely \\nresolved by discharge, with only slight periorbital edema \\nremaining. She will finish her 7-day course of valacyclovir and \\npolymyxin/bacitracin ointment on ___.\\n\\n# Chest discomfort- Resolved a few days after admission. Had \\nbeen evaluated by an outpatient provider, felt to be likely due \\nto esophagitis, and was being treated empirically as ___. \\nLow suspicion for cardiac cause given time course, normal EKG, \\nand baseline troponins. Finished 14-day course of Fluconazole \\n___.\\n\\nChronic issues:\\n\\n#ESRD on HD: During her stay, she was followed by the nephrology \\nservice and given hemodialysis on a ___ \\nschedule. She continued her home sevelamer and nephrocaps. Per \\nnephrology, her cinicalcet was continued at a reduced dose of 30 \\nmg daily.\\n\\n# Anemia- Likely from ESRD. She is at her baseline. She \\ncontinued to receive EPO with HD.  \\n\\n# AIDS: (CD4 22, VL 304,373 on ___- She was continued on \\nher home HAART regimen of emtricitabine, abacavir, ritonavir and \\nboosted atazanavir.
