  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle-aged woman with advanced AIDS on HAART, ESRD on thrice-weekly hemodialysis, prior V1 zoster with post-herpetic neuralgia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic pruritic rash presented from dialysis with worsening right-sided headache and facial pain, new right facial blistering lesions, diffuse pruritus, dizziness, and mild shortness of breath. Initial evaluation showed chronic macrocytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, ESRD-range creatinine and BUN with hyperphosphatemia and intermittent hyperkalemia, but stable baseline low blood pressure and no fever. CT chest showed no PCP and only a small nonspecific right lower lobe ground-glass opacity; CT head and later MRI brain were normal. Dermatology performed punch biopsies of the left arm and right face, which demonstrated eosinophilic hypersensitivity/folliculitis with negative HSV/VZV stains and only coagulase-negative staph on culture, leading to discontinuation of acyclovir and treatment with hydroxyzine and topical mupirocin. A fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture yielded normal CSF with negative cryptococcal antigen and cultures, ruling out CNS infection as a cause of headache. She continued M/W/F hemodialysis with transient intradialytic hypotension and improved post-dialysis chemistries; sevelamer was increased and cinacalcet continued. Her HAART regimen (abacavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, emtricitabine) and opportunistic infection prophylaxis (TMP-SMX and azithromycin) were maintained. Atrial fibrillation remained paroxysmal and was managed with aspirin alone. By discharge she was hemodynamically stable at baseline, ambulatory, with improved facial lesions, pruritus, and headache, and was discharged home with services, on her chronic dialysis schedule and updated medications, with follow-up arranged for HIV care and suture removal.",

Initial concern was for zoster reactivation, and she received systemic and topical acyclovir. Dermatology biopsies of the left arm and right face showed ulcer with neutrophilic crust and superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, consistent with hypersensitivity reaction/eosinophilic dermatitis with follicular accentuation; HSV and VZV immunostains were negative, and tissue culture grew only coagulase-negative staphylococcus. DFA and viral cultures from skin scrapings were negative for HSV and VZV. Acyclovir was discontinued after ID and Dermatology review, and she was treated with hydroxyzine for pruritus and mupirocin cream twice daily to the facial lesions. By discharge, the facial ulcerations and pustules were greatly improved, with residual but decreased pain.",
