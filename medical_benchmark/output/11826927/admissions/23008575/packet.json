The patient was placed prone in on the angiographic\ntable and her lower back was prepped and draped in the typical sterile\nfashion.  Local anesthesia was obtained using infiltration with 1% lidocaine. \nInitially, a standard 20 gauge spinal needle was inserted at the level of\nL3-4, under fluoroscopic control, but came just short of reaching the spinal\ncanal, secondary to patient's body habitus.  Subsequently, a longer 20 gauge\nspinal needle was inserted into the spinal canal, at the same (L3-4) level,\nunder fluoroscopic guidance.  Select fluoroscopic pot images were saved to\nPACS, for attending review.\n\nA total of 18 mL of clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid was collected.  The\nstylets for both spinal needles were then replaced, and both needles were then\nremoved, without complication.  Excellent hemostasis was achieved and the\npatient was transferred from the angiographic suite in stable condition.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture, with 18 mL of\nclear cerebrospinal fluid obtained for laboratory analysis and cytology;\nresults pending.\n",

There is no evidence of mass effect,\nhydrocephalus, or midline shift.  The basal cisterns are patent. There is mild\ndiffuse low signal throughout the bone marrow.\n\nThere is mild mucosal thickening of the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, maxillary,\nand mastoid air cells.  Small mucous retention cysts are visualized in both\nmaxillary sinuses.\n\nProminent lymphoid tissue in the nasopharynx.\n\nIMPRESSION:  No infarct or hemorrhage.  No evidence of abnormal FLAIR signal\nthat could suggest a parenchymal process in this non contrast MRI.\n",
