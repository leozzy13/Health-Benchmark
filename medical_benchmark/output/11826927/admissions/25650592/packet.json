No \natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The \nestimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic \nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is \nnormal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \nmasses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary \nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Minimal aortic valve sclerosis without discrete \nvegetation or pathologic aortic regurgitation. Normal \nbiventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional \nbiventricular systolic function.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nfindings are similar. \n.\nGASTROENTEROLOGY STUDIES\n.\n___ UGIS: \nFINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass, stricture, or mucosal \nirregularities in the pharynx or esophagus. The barium passed \nfreely into the stomach with normal primary peristalsis. There \nis no evidence of reflux or hiatal hernia. \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of esophageal ulcer or esophagitis. \n.\n___ EGD:\nImpression: Erythema, congestion and petechiae in the stomach \nbody and antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy)\nErythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb compatible with \nduodenitis\nOtherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum \nRecommendations: Will mail a pathology report in ___ weeks\nPrilosec 20mg BID\nThe findings do not account for her pain and fever. \nFollow-up with inpatient GI team \n.\nRADIOLOGY\n.\nCXR ___:\nFINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. \nAgain seen is a large-bore dual-lumen left-sided dialysis \ncatheter unchanged in position, terminating in the expected \nlocation of the cavoatrial junction and the right atrium. No \nfocal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.  \nThe cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt \npulmonary edema is seen.   \nIMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. \n.\nCT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: \nThe thyroid gland appears homogeneous without focal nodule. No \nsupraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy \nis identified. A large bore dual lumen hemodialysis catheter \nterminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior \nradiograph. The thoracic aorta demonstrates moderate \natherosclerotic calcification, though is non-aneurysmal. There \nis no sign of acute aortic syndrome. No mediastinal hematoma is \nidentified. There is no pulmonary embolism to subsegmental \nlevels. Incidental note is made of a left superior intercostal \nvein bordering the aortic arch. Additional epicardial veins and \na hemiazygous vein are also visualized, likely secondary to \ncontrast injection via a central line.  \nThe tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels. Mild \nbibasilar atelectasis identified. There is no focal pulmonary \nnodule, mass or pleural effusion.  \nLimited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal \nappearance of the superior liver, spleen, pancreas. Multiple \nhypodense lesions are seen throughout both kidneys superiorly, \nand are better characterized as simple cysts on prior abdominal \nultrasound. The right adrenal gland is not well visualized and \nthe left adrenal gland is normal. \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture \nis \nidentified.   \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome. \n2. Bibasilar atelectasis. \n3. Incompletely imaged hypodense lesions in the partially imaged \nsuperior kidneys correlate with cysts seen on prior abdominal \nultrasound from ___. \n.\n___: UE US:\nno evidence of clot \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with a PMH of HIV/AIDS (CDR 59 in ___ with history of \nPCP), ESRD on HD MWF presented to the ED today complaining of \nchest pain which resolves w/percoset or maalox/lidocaine, now \nw/GPC bacteremia and fever to 103.  \n.  \n# CHEST PAIN\nPatient originally presented with description of pleuritic \nsubsternal chest discomfort which was originally concerning for \ncardiac etiology but on further questioning her description was \nmore suggestive of GI etiology including odynophagia-like \nsymptoms and food intolerance. Full cardiac workup including EKG \nand serial cardiac enzymes was not suggestive of myocardial \nischemia (troponins trended up but CKMB remained flat, so in \nthis renal patient this was considered negative overall), and \nCTA was negative for PE or other pulmonary process. We \nconsidered pericarditis given her HIV+ status, but EKG showed no \nsigns of pericarditis and pt was without pericardial friction \nrub or positional component. Patient underwent full GI workup \nwith the support of the GI consult team, including upper GI \nbarium series and EGD. These revealed only mild gastritis (for \nwhich she was started on omeprazole 20 BID) but no other \npathology although we had considered candidal, CMV, or HSV \nesophagitis. She was maintained on mylanta/lidocaine cocktail \nq6H PRN in the hospital but this was stopped a few days prior to \ndischarge given the aluminum content of mylanta, which is not \ncompatible with her ESRD. Pain also resolved with percoset \n___, which she takes for diffuse myalgias/arthralgias (being \nworked up by neuro as an outpatient), so we suspect this is the \nunderlying explanation for her symptoms at this time. \n.\n#GPC BACTEREMIA\nShe spiked a fever to 102.7 on HD2, and blood cultures from that \ntime grew coag-negative staph. Source thought to be her HD line. \nStarted on vancomycin/cefepime initially; cefepime was stopped \nafter 3d when cultures showed coag-neg staph. Subsequent \nsurveillance blood cultures were negative or NGTD, but patient \nwas persistently febrile, so the HD line was removed. \n.\n# Retrocardiac opacity.  Two days prior to discharge, pt spiked \nat temperature.  She Infectious workup was done and only \nsignificant finding was a retrocardiac opacity on CXR.  She was \nstarted on cefepime.  Cultures remained negative and she did not \nspike a temperature.  Prior to discharge, repeat chest xray was \nperformed and no evidence of opacity was noted, so abx treatment \nwas discontinued.  \n.\n# HIV/AIDS \nOff HAART given non-compliance, outpatient ID specialist who is \nalso her PCP (Dr ___ is aware. Patient noted to have \nrecent low CD4 count of 59 and a high viral load, and hx PCP x3. \nID consult team followed the patient, and recommended re-started \nHAART (as was done during other recent hospitalizations). \nPatient had compliance issues in the past due to other ongoing \nsocial stressors including secrecy about HIV diagnosis and \nhousing challenges; we note that her motivation to take HAART is \ncrucial to success. Patient saw social work throughout this \nadmission, who recommended ongoing social work through Dr \n___ and also outreach to the ___. \nPatient did agree to resume both bactrim and azithromycin \nprophylaxis, which was done. \n.  \n#CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME/MYOSITIS/ARTHRITIS \nPatient known to have chronic migratory arthralgias and \nmyalgias, is s/p thorough workup performed out-of-state within \nrecent years per report. She has also recently started seeing a \nneurologist here at ___. On admission she was neurologically \nintact, with strength notable only for ___ strength in LEs. \nUnclear whether she suffers from inflammatory arthritis or \nosteoarthritis or chronic pain syndrome such as fibromyalgia. \nHer chronic pain syndrome could also explain the now-resolved \nepisode of anterior chest wall pain without reproducible \ntenderness to palpation which prompted this admission. She will \ncontinue to see neurology as an outpatient, as already \nscheduled. \n.  \n# ESRD/ACCESS\nESRD is chronic and secondary to HIV, on dialysis since ___ on \n___ schedule. Complicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism. When \nshe was persistently febrile despite vancomycin coverage, the HD \nline was removed. This was done in the context of extensive \ndiscussion about the patient's difficult access and limited \nremaining access options (s/p three failed fistulas). At time of \nline removal, ID and renal consult teams (including outpatient \nnephrologist) were all aware and agreed line removal was \nnecessary in order to fully treat her underlying bacteremia. She \nhad a 2-day line holiday, and right sided groin temporary \ntunneled HD line was placed by interventional radiology and \ndialysis was resumed. She was continued on home selevamer, \ncinacalcet & started on daily nephrocaps. Received vitamin D and \nEpo supplementation at HD. She was also started on aspirin 81 mg \nQD. \n.\n# Hx PCP ___: \nHas not been adherent to bactrim prophylaxis. This was restarted \nduring this admission.\n.  \n# Hx Chronic Anemia: \nHct at baseline during this admission without intervention. She \nwas restarted on folic acid supplementation.\n.  \n# Hx Residual Right face zoster/post herpetic neuralgia: She \ndoes not have fresh/active lesions. She was continued on home \npercoset ___. \n. \nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Started on omeprazole 20, which would need to be exchanged to \nranitidine if she starts on HAART as an outpatient.\n2. Patient in ongoing discussions with ID re: re-initiating \nHAART.\n3.  follow-up neurology appointment rescheduled.\n4.  follow-up re: HD access.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nselevamer 800mg four caps with large meals, 2 caps with snacks  \nvitamin D weekly (not currently being prescribed)\npercocet 5mg q8hrs prn \ncinacalcet 60mg po daily  \n.\nnote: patient not taking additional medications as listed in ___\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO TID \nW/MEALS (3 TIMES A DAY WITH MEALS).  \n2. oxycodone-acetaminophen ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet \nPO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for pain.  \n3. cinacalcet 30 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n4. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

A large bore dual lumen hemodialysis\ncatheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior\nradiograph.  The thoracic aorta demonstrates moderate atherosclerotic\ncalcification, though is non-aneurysmal.  There is no sign of acute aortic\nsyndrome.  No mediastinal hematoma is identified.  There is no pulmonary\nembolism to subsegmental levels.  Incidental note is made of a left superior\nintercostal vein bordering the aortic arch.  Additional epicardial veins and a\nhemiazygous vein are also visualized, likely secondary to contrast injection\nvia a central line.  \n\nThe tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels.  Mild bibasilar\natelectasis identified.  There is no focal pulmonary nodule, mass or pleural\neffusion.\n\nLimited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal appearance of the\nsuperior liver, spleen, pancreas.  Multiple hypodense lesions are seen\nthroughout both kidneys superiorly, and are better characterized as simple\ncysts on prior abdominal ultrasound.  The right adrenal gland is not well\nvisualized and the left adrenal gland is normal.\n\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is\nidentified.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.\n2.  Bibasilar atelectasis.\n3.
