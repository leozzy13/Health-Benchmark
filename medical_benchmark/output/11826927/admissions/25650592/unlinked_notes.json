The basilic vein on this side is also quite small below the elbow\nmeasuring between 1.4 and 1.8 mm, 2.4 mm above the elbow and 2.9 mm towards\nthe axilla.  Brachial artery is visualized and is reportedly duplicated. \nUnclear whether this is real or just represents high takeoff of the radial\nartery.\nLeft upper extremity:\nCephalic vein is patent and measures 0.9-1 mm in the forearm, 1.7 at the level\nof the elbow and 1.7-3.3 towards the shoulder.

Metallic BBs\nplaced in the bilateral breast areas of clinical concern as directed by the\npatient.  Computer aided detection was utilized and assisted with\ninterpretation.  Targeted ultrasound was performed with patient sitting in\nwheelchair as she recently had leg amputation and requires mechanical lift to\nstretcher, which was not available.\n\nFINDINGS: \n\nTissue density: C- The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense which may\nobscure detection of small masses.\nUnderlying the metallic BB in the right breast, there are 2 adjacent masses, 1\nreniform and 1 oval with circumscribed margins.

However, given similar\nappearance of bilateral breast masses, patient comorbidities and limited\nmobility, including HIV/AIDS, biopsy of at least the dominant mass in the\nright breast is recommended to exclude other etiologies, including breast\ncarcinoma, lymphoma or HIV related malignancy.\n\nRECOMMENDATION(S):  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of dominant right breast\nmass.\n\nNOTIFICATION:  Findings and recommendation for biopsy were reviewed with the\npatient who agrees with this plan.
