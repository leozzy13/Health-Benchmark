  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle‑aged woman with advanced HIV/AIDS off HAART, ESRD on thrice‑weekly hemodialysis, chronic anemia, and chronic pain presented with pleuritic substernal chest pain and new odynophagia. Initial evaluation showed stable vital signs, a normal EKG, and chest imaging without acute cardiopulmonary pathology; CTA chest ruled out pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection, and serial cardiac enzymes showed modest troponin elevation with flat CK‑MB, interpreted as non‑ischemic in the setting of ESRD. She subsequently developed high fevers and was found to have coagulase‑negative staphylococcal bacteremia, attributed to her tunneled hemodialysis catheter; broad‑spectrum antibiotics were started, then narrowed to vancomycin, and the infected line was removed after multidisciplinary discussion. Because venography demonstrated bilateral central subclavian occlusions, a tunneled right femoral hemodialysis catheter was placed for ongoing access. GI evaluation for chest discomfort and dysphagia included an upper GI barium study, which was normal, and EGD, which showed gastritis and duodenitis; she was started on omeprazole with symptomatic improvement. She also developed a small left lower lobe pneumonia on chest radiograph, treated transiently with cefepime until radiographic resolution and persistently negative cultures. Throughout the stay she continued sevelamer, cinacalcet, epoetin, vitamin D analogs, and renal vitamins for ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and Bactrim and azithromycin prophylaxis were restarted for HIV. By discharge she was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, ambulating independently, tolerating diet with improved odynophagia, and had negative follow‑up blood cultures; she was discharged home with services, to continue vancomycin with dialysis and her revised outpatient medication regimen.",
