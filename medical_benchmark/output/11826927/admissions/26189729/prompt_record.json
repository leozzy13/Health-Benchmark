Per report, she had an uneventful HD session \\ntoday and arrived home without incident. While lying down on the \\ncouch she had the sudden onset of weakness, lightheadedness, and \\nmild sensation of room spinning. Most prominent symptom was \\nweakness; patient was unable to get herself off the couch. She \\nbecame nauseous and had one episode of NBNB vomiting. She called \\n911 and when EMS arrived they had to have the fire department \\nbreak down her door because she was unable to get up to answer \\nit.

Symptoms were most likely due to \\nLyrica, which was stopped. \\n\\nACTIVE ISSUES\\n1. Lightheadedness & Weakness: Patient's symptoms of weakness, \\nlightheadedness, and malaise are most likley secondary to \\nstarting Lyrica given she had started the drug two days before \\nsymptom onset and had a similar reaction to gabapentin. Patient \\nremained afebrile and had no localizing infectious symptoms \\nbeyond the one episode of nausea and vomiting at home. On \\nadmission, she had several blood pressures below her baseline \\nSBP of 80's-90's, which were concerning for an atypical \\npresentation of sepsis in this severely immunocompromised \\npatient.  She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Blood \\npressures improved with 1.5L IVF. Antibiotics were stopped and \\nno further infectious symptoms/signs developed and blood \\ncultures were no growth at discharge. Lyrica was stopped on \\nadmission and patient was advised not to take it again. \\nLightheadedness and weakness were improved at the time of \\ndischarge. Orthostatics were negative. \\n \\n2. ESRD: Due to HIVAN, on HD MWF at ___. Does not make \\nurine. Patient underwent HD on ___ without complication. \\n\\n3. AIDS: Not currently no ___. Reports she received blister \\npacks with ___ medications but has not started them yet. \\nFollowed closely by Dr. ___ as an outpatient. Patient was \\ncontinued on azithromycin and bactrim prophylaxis. She was \\nencouraged to work with Dr. ___ to restart ___ upon \\ndischarge.\\n\\n4. Low Health Literacy: Patient demonstrated low health literacy \\nsurrounding her HIV and her medications. She was unsure of her \\ndaily medications and dosing, so medication reconciliation was \\nperformed based on review of OMR and recent chart notes. Patient \\nwould likely benefit from meeting with pharmacist for medication \\nteaching as an outpatient. \\n\\n6. Right V1 Post-Herpetic Neuralgia/Headache: Patient continued \\nto have pain in her right V1 distribution, which has been \\nchronic since a zoster infection in that nerve. Lyrica was \\nstopped as above. Although patient has ESRD, her outpatient and \\ninpatient providers agreed that her neuropathic pain is \\nsignificantly impairing her quality of life. She was started on \\nlow-dose duloxetine three times a week post-HD after \\nconsultation with her outpatient providers. \\n\\n7. Depressed Mood: No active SI. Seen by ___. Would \\nbenefit from outpatient Psychiatry. \\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n1. Eosinophilia: Dr. ___ considering ___ for \\nstrongyloides given patient is originally from ___. This \\nacute presentation is not suggestive of strongyloidiasis, so no \\ntesting was performed. \\n\\n2. Paroxysmal A. Fib: Not currently anticoagulated, in sinus \\nrhythm. \\n\\n3.. Social Issues: Per prior OMR notes, patient has significant \\nsocial barriers to participation in her HIV and other medical \\ncare. She was seen by ___ and encouraged to \\nfollow-up with her outpatient SW. \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n- Work with Dr. ___ to resume ___ therapy with blister packs\\n- Encourage patient to establish with outpatient Psychiatrist\\n- Consider visit with ___ pharmacist for medication teaching\\n- Monitor for side effects on duloxetine\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \\nfuther investigation.\\n1.

a multi-turn inpatient conversation for this admission session.\n\nHard requirements:\n- Discharge note text(s) from notes.discharge MUST influence the conversation and MUST be cited when used.\n- The conversation must be medically and temporally coherent with the structured data (labs, orders, service changes, radiology).\n- Use a mix of speakers typical for an inpatient stay: PATIENT, ATTENDING, RESIDENT, NURSE (optional), CONSULT (optional).\n- Do not copy the discharge summary verbatim as dialogue. Use it to guide what happened.\n\nEvidence rules:\n- For each turn, include a list of EIDs supporting that turn’s medical content.\n- If a turn contains only social talk (e.g., greeting), evidence may be [].\n\nOutput JSON schema (must match exactly):\n{\n  \"conversation\": [\n    {\n      \"turn_id\": integer (starts at 1),\n      \"speaker\": \"PATIENT\" | \"ATTENDING\" | \"RESIDENT\" | \"NURSE\" | \"CONSULT\",\n      \"relative_time\": string,\n      \"text\": string,\n      \"evidence_eids\": [string, ...]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"end_of_admission_summary\": {\n    \"relative_discharge_time\": string,\n    \"one_paragraph_summary\": string,\n    \"problem_list\": [\n      {\n        \"problem\": string,\n        \"status_at_discharge\": string,\n        \"supporting_eids\": [string, ...]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"key_tests_and_results\": [\n      {\n        \"test\": string,\n        \"result\": string,\n        \"relative_time\": string,\n        \"supporting_eids\": [string, ...]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"treatments_and_meds\": [\n      {\n        \"treatment_or_med\": string,\n        \"details\": string,\n        \"supporting_eids\": [string, ...]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"disposition\": {\n      \"discharge_location\": string,\n      \"supporting_eids\": [string, ...]\n    }\n  }\n}\n<<END_TASK>>",
