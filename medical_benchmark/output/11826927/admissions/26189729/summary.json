  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this short observation admission, a middle-aged woman with advanced AIDS and ESRD on hemodialysis presented from home after dialysis with acute lightheadedness, weakness, and one episode of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting, without fever or focal infectious symptoms. Initial ED vitals showed hypotension that improved with IV fluids; she received empiric piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin due to concern for sepsis in an immunocompromised host, but chest radiograph was clear and blood cultures remained negative, so antibiotics were discontinued. Her history revealed that pregabalin (Lyrica) had been started two days prior for chronic right V1 post-herpetic neuralgia, with a prior similar intolerance to gabapentin. Given the temporal association and lack of infectious source, her lightheadedness and weakness were attributed to a medication side effect of pregabalin, exacerbated by ESRD and post-dialysis hypotension. Lyrica was stopped, and her symptoms improved. She continued thrice-weekly hemodialysis in hospital, with management of hyperkalemia (K 6.5 mEq/L) and uremia, and received cinacalcet, sevelamer, doxercalciferol, and heparin per dialysis protocol. Her chronic AIDS prophylaxis with azithromycin and TMP-SMX was continued, while full antiretroviral therapy was deferred to outpatient management. For neuropathic pain, she was started on low-dose duloxetine three times weekly post-dialysis. She remained hemodynamically stable at her baseline low pressures, with improved lightheadedness and no new infectious signs, and was discharged home with services on her chronic dialysis schedule and updated medications.",

Infectious workup including chest X-ray and blood cultures was negative, and she remained afebrile without localizing symptoms. Symptoms were attributed to a side effect of recently started pregabalin (Lyrica), especially given prior similar intolerance to gabapentin and underlying ESRD. Lyrica was discontinued on admission, IV fluids were given, and empiric antibiotics were stopped once sepsis was deemed unlikely. Orthostatic vitals were negative, and by discharge her lightheadedness and weakness had significantly improved.",
