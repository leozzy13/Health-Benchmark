  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle‑aged woman with advanced AIDS off HAART and ESRD on hemodialysis presented from dialysis with pain, swelling, and purulent drainage around a right femoral tunneled dialysis catheter, along with post‑dialysis hypotension. She was briefly hypotensive in the ED but responded to approximately 3 liters of IV fluids and remained hemodynamically stable thereafter. Workup showed clear lungs and normal heart size on chest X‑ray, mild stress‑type troponin elevation without ischemic EKG changes, and chronic macrocytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia consistent with HIV‑related pancytopenia and CKD. The infected right femoral catheter was removed, blood cultures remained negative, and she received an empiric 7‑day course of vancomycin (with early cefepime discontinued) while a new left femoral tunneled dialysis catheter was placed under IR guidance after an initial failed attempt. Difficult catheter advancement raised concern for IVC thrombus, prompting a short heparin infusion, but CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed a patent IVC without thrombus, innumerable bilateral renal cysts, and small splenic hemangiomas, so anticoagulation was stopped. She continued thrice‑weekly hemodialysis via the new catheter with improved BUN/creatinine and potassium control, completed a short course of nystatin for presumed oral candidiasis, and remained off HAART while continuing PCP and MAC prophylaxis. Her right thigh infection site healed without abscess or bacteremia, her blood pressure stabilized at her low baseline, and she was discharged home with visiting nurse services, a functioning left femoral dialysis catheter, and follow‑up arranged for HIV care, nephrology, mood, and chronic pain.",

Ultrasound of the right thigh showed soft tissue edema and a small amount of subcutaneous fluid but no drainable abscess. She never developed fever or bacteremia, the right thigh site healed with no fluctuance or drainage, and her blood pressure stabilized in the 90–100 systolic range without further fluid or pressors. At discharge the infection was clinically resolved and she was off IV antibiotics.",
