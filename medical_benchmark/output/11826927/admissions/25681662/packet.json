Her hospital course \nwas significant for suspicion of IVC DVT which was ruled out by \nimaging.  She was discharged home after completing an empiric \ncourse of Vancomycin.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n\n#Line infection: suspected, never bacteremic, s/p empiric \ntreatment. \nR ___ U/S was performed to rule out an abscess at the site of her \nAV fistula, no drainable collection.  Patient was treated \ninitially with cefepime (which was d/c'd due to low suspicion of \nGNR infection) and 7 days of vancomycin dosed at dialysis \nfollowing line pull (last dose ___.  ___ helped replace a \ntunneled line on the left side without complication.  She never \ndeveloped fever or bacteremia. \n\n#Suspected IVC thrombus: ruled out by imaging.\nImaging during femoral catheter placement suggested possible \nthrombus in IVC. Hematology was connsulted (anticoagulation in a \npatient with uncertain compliance would be risky).  Heparin was \nstarted, but after further imaging with CT venogram which showed \nin fact there was no clot, heparin was d/c'd. This was about 24 \nhrs after heparin was started.\n\n#Hypotension: Patient initially presented to ED with BP in ___ \ns/p dialysis and finding of infected femoral HD line. Patient \nwas given 3L fluid and pressures normalized into the \n___. She was asymptomatic. No further fluid was given \nout of concern for triggering pulmonary edema without HD access. \nPt tends to become hypotensive during dialysis.\n\n#EKG showing bigeminy: a new finding this admission.\nPt had an EKG done while at HD on ___ due to alarming for \nbradycardia and was noted to have premature atrial beats in a \nbigeminal pattern. Rate was in fact 80. She was asymptomatic and \nhemodynamically stable; repeat EKG on the medical floor no \nlonger showed this.\n\n#. h/o AFib: previously undocumented, will increase ASA to \n___.\nOn reviewing old EKGs due to the incident above, it was noted \nthat she has had AFib/RVR in the setting of sepsis in the past \n(specifically on ___ and ___.  Her CHADS2 score is low \nso no clear indication for Warfarin (especially given \nquestionable med compliance), but her Aspirin dose was increased \nfrom 81mg to 325mg daily.\n\nINACTIVE ISSUES\n\n# Anemia: ? renal failure versus initial hemoconcentration \nversus possible bruising bleeding from procedures.  We monitored \nher Hb which ranged in the 9.5 range.\n  \n# HIV off HAART: Patient has had long relationship with Dr. \n___ (PCP) and has had frequent discussions as outpatient \nregarding the risks of her going on and off HAART therapy. Per \ntheir discussion ~3wks ago, patient is still not up to it given \nher mood and n/v with the meds. She was agreeable to taking her \nppx for opportunistic infections, however.

We \ncontinued Cinacalcet 60 mg PO DAILY and we halved her sevelamer \nCARBONATE  1600 with meals and 800 with snacks due to low phos.  \nWe also started patient on nephrocaps.\n\n# Postherpetic neuralgia: \n- OxycoDONE (Immediate Release) 2.5 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN pain, \nneuralgia pls hold for RR<10, oversedation\n- Acetaminophen ___ mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN pain, fever limit \n4g/day\n- gabapentin 300 mg PO/NG Q48H\n- HydrOXYzine 25 mg PO/NG TID:PRN itching\n\n# Depression: Patient has struggled with depression, and now has \nevidence of acute depression.  Patient previously treated with \namytriptyline but stopped due to dry mouth. She saw psyciatry \nand per their recommendations did not start any new medications \nalthough if possible as an outpatient, they recommended remeron \n7.5mg and close social work follow up (___). \n\n# Throat pain: Patient complained of throat pain on admission. \nOut of concern for candidiasis, ENT was consulted for thorough \nexam, Nystatin started emperically for 6 days. She felt better \nat the end of hospital day.\n\n# Transitional:\n- outpatient social work\n- follow up line infection to make sure it is stil getting \nbetter\n- HIV: f/u with HIV provider\n- CRF: f/u Dr ___\n- ___ neuralgia: f/u with PCP. \n- Anemia: likely related to ESRD, f.u with Dr ___\n \n___ on Admission:\n1. azithromycin 600 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO 1X/WEEK \n(___).  \n2. cinacalcet 30 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n\n3. hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three \ntimes a day as needed for itching.\n4. ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet \nPO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.  \n5. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg Tablet Sig: Five (5) Tablet PO TID \nW/MEALS (3 TIMES A DAY WITH MEALS).\nDisp:*150 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO QHD (each hemodialysis).  \n7. docusate sodium 100 mg BID\n8. aspirin 81 daily  \n9. folic acid 1 mg daily.  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Dr. ___ was present during key moments of the procedure.\n\nCONTRAST:  None.\n\nMEDICATION:  IV 3 mg Versed over 1 hour and 20 minutes, during which patient's\nhemodynamic status was continuously monitored by a trained radiology nurse. \nModerate sedation could not be administered due to airway IV.\n\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Consent was obtained from patient after explaining\nthe benefits, risks, and alternatives.  Patient was placed supine on the\nimaging table in the interventional suite.  Timeout was performed as per ___\nprotocol.\n\nUnder aseptic conditions, sonographic guidance, and after infiltrating the\nskin and subcutaneous tissues with adequate amounts of 1% lidocaine, a\nmicropuncture needle was placed in the patent left common femoral vein at the\nlevel of mid-to-lower femoral head.  Sonographic images were printed prior to\nand following needle placement.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle\nand into the common iliac vein.  After making incision at the access site, the\nneedle was exchanged for a 4.5 ___ microsheath.  Inner cannula and wire\nwere removed to place a 0.035 ___ wire, which was eventually advanced into\nthe ___.  After appropriate measurements, a site was chosen on the left\nanterior thigh.  Skin was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine prior to incision. \nSubcutaneous tissues along the proposed tunnel were infiltrated with a mixture\nof lidocaine and epinephrine.  A 15.5 ___ 50 cm (tip-to-cuff) hemodialysis\ncatheter was tunneled from the skin incision to exit at the venotomy site with\nthe help of a blunt metallic tunneler.  After removing the microsheath, a\nKumpe catheter was used to exchange the ___ wire for an Amplatz wire, which\nwas advanced to the ___.  After removing the Kumpe catheter, the tract was\ndilated sequentially with 12 and 14 ___ dilators, prior to placing a 16\n___ peel-away sheath.  After removing the inner cannula and wire, attempts\nwere made to advance the catheter via the peel-away sheath; however, we were\nunable to completely advance the catheter.  Multiple attempts were made, at\nwhich time the patient wanted to stop the procedure.  She also did not want us\nto attempt a temporary dialysis catheter placement at this time.  Sheath was\nremoved, and firm pressure was applied to the venotomy site for about 10\nminutes to achieve complete hemostasis.  Tunneled catheter was also removed. \nSites were dressed in a sterile fashion.

        "text": "TUNNELED HEMODIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT.\n\nINDICATION:  ___ woman with end-stage renal disease, HIV, on dialysis.\n\nOPERATORS:  Drs. ___ (fellow) and ___ (attending\nphysician).  Dr. ___ was present during key moments of the procedure.\n\nCONTRAST:  Sterile 15 mL Optiray 320.\n\nANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia provided by the anesthesiologist.\n\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Consent was obtained from the patient after\nexplaining the benefits, risks, and alternatives.  Patient was placed supine\non the imaging table in the interventional suite.  Timeout was performed as\nper ___ protocol.\n\nUnder aseptic conditions, sonographic guidance, and after infiltrating the\nskin and subcutaneous tissues with 1% lidocaine, a micropuncture needle was\nplaced in the patent left common femoral vein at the level of mid-to-lower\nfemoral head.  Sonographic images were printed prior to and following needle\nplacement.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle and into the iliac\nvein.  After making an incision at the access site, needle was removed to\nplace a 4.5 ___ microsheath.  After removing the inner cannula and wire,\n0.035 ___ wire was advanced via the microsheath and eventually into the SVC.\nAfter removing the microsheath, the ___ wire was exchanged with a 0.035\nstiff Amplatz wire with the help of a 5 ___ Kumpe catheter.  Appropriate\nsite was chosen on the left anterior thigh.  After making an incision and\ninfiltrating the subcutaneous tissues along the proposed tunnel, 15.5 ___\n50-cm (tip-to-cuff) hemodialysis catheter was tunneled to exit at the venotomy\nsite with the help of a blunt metallic tunneler.  After removing the Kumpe\ncatheter, the tract was dilated under fluoroscopy sequentially with 12 and 14\n___ dilators, prior to placing a 16 ___ 30-cm peel-away sheath.  After\nremoving the wire and inner cannula, the tunneled catheter advanced through\nthe peel-away sheath.  However, it was very difficult to completely advance\nthe catheter.  A 0.035 ___ wire was placed via the blue lumen of the\ncatheter and used to help further advance the catheter tip to the level of the\nupper IVC.  It was still very difficult to further advance the remaining\nportion of the catheter.  Sheath away completely, the catheter was retracted\nat the entry site.  After removing the ___ wire, two 0.035 stiff Glidewire\nwere placed in the lumens of the catheter and advanced into the SVC.  Catheter\nwas then advanced over these wires to place the tip in the right atrium. \nAfter removing the wires, we attempted to aspirate and flush the lumens,\nhowever, we were unable to do so.  At this time, catheter tip was repositioned\nto different levels, however, we were still unable to aspirate and flush. \nHence, the catheter was removed over two stiff Glidewire.  A Kumpe catheter\nwas placed over one of the wires and advanced to the lower IVC.  A small\namount of sterile contrast material was hand injected, which demonstrated\nlikely partial thrombus in the IVC.  After removing the catheter and one of\nthe wires, a long 16 ___ peel-away sheath was placed over the second wire\nand advanced into the lower IVC.  After removing the inner cannula, a new 15.5\n___ 50-cm (tip-to-cuff) hemodialysis catheter was placed over the wires to\npartially advance the catheter to the level of left iliac vein.  After peeling\naway the sheath, another stiff Glidewire was placed in the other lumen to help\nfeed the catheter to position tip in the right atrium.  After removing the\nwire, we were able to aspirate and flush both the lumens successfully.  Small\namount of sterile contrast material was injected through the blue lumen to\nconfirm patency and good flush.  Catheters were flushed with saline again.  A\nsingle ___ Vicryl suture was placed in the venotomy site.  Catheter was\nsecured by 0 silk sutures.  The sites were dressed in a sterile fashion.  The\npatient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate post-procedure\ncomplication was seen.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided placement of 15.5\n___ 50-cm (tip-to-cuff) tunneled hemodialysis catheter via the patent left\ncommon femoral vein and with its tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is\nready for use.  Please note that it was extremely difficult to advance the\ncatheter past the left common iliac vein and through the IVC.  A small amount\nof contrast injected through the IVC demonstrated likely thrombus.  If\nclinically indicated, CT venogram or MR venogram may be performed.\n\nResults were discussed over the phone with Dr. ___ at around 3 p.m.\non ___.\n",

Question is\nwhether this is acute versus chronic thrombus, would affect decision regarding\nanticoagulation.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: \nMultidetector scanning is performed from the diaphragm through the symphysis\nprior to and during dynamic injection of 150 cc of Omnipaque.  No prior\nstudies are available for comparison.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is some atelectasis at\nthe lung bases.  No lung nodules are noted.  The liver is without focal\nlesions.  The gallbladder is unremarkable.  The spleen is normal in size and\ncontains a 0.9 cm hypodense lesion that is too small to characterize as well\nas a 1.9 cm hypodense lesion that measures 43 Hounsfield units.  These are\nmost consistent with hemangiomas.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  The adrenal\nglands are normal.  Multiple renal cysts are noted bilaterally.  A 0.6 cm\ncalcification is noted in the right kidney.  There is no retroperitoneal\nlymphadenopathy.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There is no excretion of\ncontrast into the renal collecting system.  A catheter is identified in the\nIVC and extends into the right atrium.  The IVC is opacified and there is no\nevidence for a filling defect that is consistent with a thrombus.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The uterus is unremarkable.  Two follicles\nare seen in the right ovary measuring 1.5 and 2.0 cm.  There is no free fluid\nin the pelvis.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified.  The pelvic veins are\npatent.  In the right groin, there are two stents identified originating from\nthe common femoral artery and this appeared to be occluded.  Fat stranding is\nidentified in the left groin surrounding the venous catheter consistent with a\nsmall amount of hemorrhage at the insertion site.\n\nOn bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No evidence of thrombosis of the IVC.  The IVC contains a central venous\nline and is patent.\n\n2.  Innumerable bilateral renal cysts.\n\n3.  Two splenic lesions most consistent with hemangiomas.\n",
