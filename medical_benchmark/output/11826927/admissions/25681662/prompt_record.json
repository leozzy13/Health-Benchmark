After making an incision and\\ninfiltrating the subcutaneous tissues along the proposed tunnel, 15.5 ___\\n50-cm (tip-to-cuff) hemodialysis catheter was tunneled to exit at the venotomy\\nsite with the help of a blunt metallic tunneler.  After removing the Kumpe\\ncatheter, the tract was dilated under fluoroscopy sequentially with 12 and 14\\n___ dilators, prior to placing a 16 ___ 30-cm peel-away sheath.

It was still very difficult to further advance the remaining\\nportion of the catheter.  Sheath away completely, the catheter was retracted\\nat the entry site.  After removing the ___ wire, two 0.035 stiff Glidewire\\nwere placed in the lumens of the catheter and advanced into the SVC.  Catheter\\nwas then advanced over these wires to place the tip in the right atrium. \\nAfter removing the wires, we attempted to aspirate and flush the lumens,\\nhowever, we were unable to do so.  At this time, catheter tip was repositioned\\nto different levels, however, we were still unable to aspirate and flush. \\nHence, the catheter was removed over two stiff Glidewire.  A Kumpe catheter\\nwas placed over one of the wires and advanced to the lower IVC.
