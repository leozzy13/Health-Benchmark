She improved quickly with a small fluid bolus \\nand soon titrated off pressors.  The patient received one dose \\nof vanc/zosyn in the ED out of concern for infectious etiology, \\nbut infectious work up in the MICU was all negative.  On \\ntransfer from the MICU to the ward, the patient continued to \\nremain normotensive.  She was continued on her home dialysis \\nschedule.   \\n\\n# shortness of breath:  The etiology of the patient's shortness \\nof breath is unclear.  She was ruled out for PE with CTA, and \\nthere were no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  The patient \\nhad elevated LDH in the setting of low CD4 count; however, she \\nreports taking her Bactrim ppx and was never hypoxic, making PCP \\nvery unlikely.  An ECHO was done to evaluate for any underlying \\npulmonary hypertension which was remarkable for ASD and mild MR. \\n ___ that the patient's shortness of breath was in the \\nsetting of being volume overloaded and did resolve after her \\ninitial HD session, but then led to resultant hypotension after \\ntaking off too much fluid.  Upon discharge, the patient was not \\nhaving any shortness of breath.   \\n\\n# Elevated LDH: The patient was noted to have elevated LDH and \\nin the setting of having a borderline calcium, elevated \\neosinophils, and relatively new thrombocytopenia, the work up \\nfor lymphoma/malignancy was started while the patient was in the \\nintensive care unit.  An u/s was done showing a borderline \\nincreased spleen compared to a study from ___.  The \\npatient was also found to have elevated B2 microglobulin, IgG \\nand IgM, and PEP was c/w polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.   \\n\\n# Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new thrombocytopenia since \\n___.  Her platelets were trended during this admission. \\nUncler etiolgy, but could be secondary to bone marrow \\nsuppression in the setting of her active HIV disease.  \\n\\n# ESRD on HD: The patient was continued on her home MWF HD \\nschedule while in patinet.  She was continued on her home \\ncinacalcet and sevelamer, which was increased at discharge. \\n\\n# HIV: The patient is not taking her HAART medications, with \\nlast CD4 of ___,000 copies/ml on ___.  The patient \\nwas not started on HAART while in patient, as she has not been \\ntaking the medications at home.
