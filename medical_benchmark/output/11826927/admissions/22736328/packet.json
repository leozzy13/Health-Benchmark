Color flow \nDoppler does not identify a discrete defect. The estimated right \natrial pressure is ___ mmHg.

She improved quickly with a small fluid bolus \nand soon titrated off pressors.  The patient received one dose \nof vanc/zosyn in the ED out of concern for infectious etiology, \nbut infectious work up in the MICU was all negative.  On \ntransfer from the MICU to the ward, the patient continued to \nremain normotensive.  She was continued on her home dialysis \nschedule.   \n\n# shortness of breath:  The etiology of the patient's shortness \nof breath is unclear.  She was ruled out for PE with CTA, and \nthere were no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  The patient \nhad elevated LDH in the setting of low CD4 count; however, she \nreports taking her Bactrim ppx and was never hypoxic, making PCP \nvery unlikely.  An ECHO was done to evaluate for any underlying \npulmonary hypertension which was remarkable for ASD and mild MR. \n ___ that the patient's shortness of breath was in the \nsetting of being volume overloaded and did resolve after her \ninitial HD session, but then led to resultant hypotension after \ntaking off too much fluid.  Upon discharge, the patient was not \nhaving any shortness of breath.   \n\n# Elevated LDH: The patient was noted to have elevated LDH and \nin the setting of having a borderline calcium, elevated \neosinophils, and relatively new thrombocytopenia, the work up \nfor lymphoma/malignancy was started while the patient was in the \nintensive care unit.  An u/s was done showing a borderline \nincreased spleen compared to a study from ___.  The \npatient was also found to have elevated B2 microglobulin, IgG \nand IgM, and PEP was c/w polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.   \n\n# Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new thrombocytopenia since \n___.  Her platelets were trended during this admission. \nUncler etiolgy, but could be secondary to bone marrow \nsuppression in the setting of her active HIV disease.  \n\n# ESRD on HD: The patient was continued on her home MWF HD \nschedule while in patinet.  She was continued on her home \ncinacalcet and sevelamer, which was increased at discharge. \n\n# HIV: The patient is not taking her HAART medications, with \nlast CD4 of ___,000 copies/ml on ___.  The patient \nwas not started on HAART while in patient, as she has not been \ntaking the medications at home.  She was continued on her \nBactrim and Azithro ppx, which she reports taking at home.  The \npatient has follow up with her ID doctor, ___.  \n\nTransitional Issues:\n- The patient was found to have elevated B2 microglobulin, IgG \nand IgM, and PEP was c/w polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.  \nThis will need to be followed up as an oupatient.     \n\n- The patient had ECHO which was notable for ASD and mild MR.  \n\n- The patient is currently not taking her HAART.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nCinacalcet 60 mg daily\nhydroxyzine 25 mg TID PRN\nPercocet 5mg-325mg QID\nsevelamer 3200 qmeal, 1600 qsnack  \nVitamin D 50,000 units Qweek  \nBactrim 800-160 3x/week\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. azithromycin 600 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO 1X/WEEK \n(___).  \n2. cinacalcet 30 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n \n3. hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three \ntimes a day as needed for itching.\nDisp:*10 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n4. oxycodone-acetaminophen ___ mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet \nPO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.  \n5. sevelamer carbonate 800 mg Tablet Sig: Five (5) Tablet PO TID \nW/MEALS (3 TIMES A DAY WITH MEALS).\nDisp:*150 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 800-160 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) \nTablet PO QHD (each hemodialysis).  \n7. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).  \n8. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO once a day.  \n9. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nprimary diagnosis:\nshortness of breath\nhypotension \n\nsecondary diagnosis:\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\nend stage renal disease on hemodialysis\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \nor cane).\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Ms. ___, \n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized \nat ___.  You were admitted to the hospital because you were \nhaving shortness of breath, then later developed low blood \npressures during dialysis.  You were initially admitted to the \nintensive care unit where your blood pressures were stabilized.\n\nOn transfer out of the ICU, your shortness of breath had also \nresolved.  You had blood tests and an ultrasound to look for \ncomplications of your HIV including lymphoma, which were \ngenerally unrevealing; you had elevated levels of \nimmunoglobulins in your blood, which is a non-specific finding.\n\nWe changed the following medications:\nPlease increase SEVELAMER to 4000 mg three times daily, with \nmeals\n\nPlease follow up with Dr. ___.
