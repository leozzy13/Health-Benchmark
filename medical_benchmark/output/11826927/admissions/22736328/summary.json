  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle‑aged woman with HIV off HAART and ESRD on hemodialysis presented after an extra dialysis session with exertional shortness of breath and symptomatic hypotension, likely from excessive ultrafiltration. In the ED she was briefly supported with vasopressors and a small fluid bolus, then admitted to the MICU, where her blood pressure quickly stabilized and her dyspnea resolved. Workup showed no acute cardiopulmonary process on chest X‑ray and CT angiography, and cardiology attributed a modest troponin T elevation with flat CK/CK‑MB and normal EKG to stress and renal disease rather than myocardial infarction. She remained on her thrice‑weekly hemodialysis schedule, with careful volume removal and continuation of cinacalcet, sevelamer (dose increased at discharge), and doxercalciferol. Evaluation of elevated LDH, new thrombocytopenia, and chronic cytopenias included abdominal ultrasound and serum studies, which demonstrated borderline splenomegaly, innumerable renal cysts, elevated beta‑2 microglobulin and immunoglobulins, and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia pattern without imaging evidence of lymphoma. Her HIV therapy was not restarted in‑hospital, but Pneumocystis and MAC prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole‑trimethoprim and azithromycin were continued. She remained afebrile with negative blood cultures, normotensive off pressors, and without recurrent dyspnea, and was discharged home ambulatory with assistance, to continue outpatient dialysis and follow up for HIV management and further evaluation of her hematologic abnormalities.",

At discharge she was normotensive on the ward, and the hypotension was attributed to excessive ultrafiltration during dialysis.",
