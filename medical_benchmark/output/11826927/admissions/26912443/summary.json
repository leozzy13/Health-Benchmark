  "one_paragraph_summary": "During this admission, a middle‑aged woman with HIV/AIDS (CD4 6), ESRD on hemodialysis, and prior herpes zoster ophthalmicus with post‑herpetic neuralgia presented from dialysis with worsening right‑sided headache and facial pain, blurry vision, diffuse pruritic rash, dizziness, and hypotension. Initial ED vitals showed systolic BP in the 70s–80s and leukopenia; she received about 3 L of IV fluids, broad‑spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime) and acyclovir for possible line or CNS infection or zoster reactivation, and was admitted to the MICU. CT head showed no acute intracranial process but marked falx/tentorium calcifications attributed to ESRD, and chest X‑ray showed clear lungs and a well‑positioned inferior dialysis catheter without acute disease. Labs demonstrated chronic macrocytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, ESRD‑range creatinine and BUN, mild hyperphosphatemia, and very low CD4 count. She had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during fluid resuscitation, then reverted to sinus rhythm; troponin was mildly elevated with normal CK/CK‑MB. With stabilization of blood pressure near her low baseline and no clear infectious source, antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued, and a cosyntropin stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency. Dermatologic findings were consistent with eosinophilic folliculitis and chronic post‑herpetic changes; pruritus was treated with fexofenadine and Sarna lotion, and post‑herpetic neuralgia with amitriptyline plus PRN oxycodone and acetaminophen. Ophthalmology found no new ocular zoster. She continued cinacalcet, sevelamer, and thrice‑weekly hemodialysis, with transient intradialytic hypotension responding to a small saline bolus. HIV prophylaxis with TMP‑SMX three times weekly and azithromycin weekly was restarted. By discharge she was hemodynamically stable at her baseline, ambulatory, with improved pain and pruritus, and was discharged home on her chronic dialysis schedule and updated medications, with outpatient follow‑up arranged.",

She received approximately 3 L of normal saline with improvement of systolic BP into the 90s–100s. Broad‑spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime) and acyclovir were started empirically for possible line or CNS infection or zoster reactivation. CT head and CXR showed no acute process, lactate was only mildly elevated, and no clear infectious source was identified. Cosyntropin stimulation testing showed an adequate cortisol response, ruling out adrenal insufficiency. Her blood pressure stabilized near her chronic low baseline (80s–90s systolic), and antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued. She had transient intradialytic hypotension on the floor that responded to a 200 cc NS bolus. At discharge she was asymptomatic with baseline low BP and no evidence of sepsis or adrenal failure.",

Additional analgesia included PRN oxycodone immediate‑release 5–10 mg PO and acetaminophen 650 mg PO. These measures led to improvement in her headache and facial pain by discharge, and she was sent home with prescriptions for amitriptyline and PRN analgesics.",
