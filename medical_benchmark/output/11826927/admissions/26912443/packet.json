Again noted is exuberant calcification of the falx and \ntentorium\ncerebelli, likely related to patient's known underlying \nend-stage renal\ndisease.\n\nCXR-  IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.\n\nECG ___\nAtrial fibrillation. Borderline rapid ventricular response. \nSince the\nprevious tracing atrial fibrillation is new. Clinical \ncorrelation is\nsuggested.\n\nECG ___\nSinus rhythm. The tracing is within normal limits. Compared to \nthe previous\ntracing of ___ sinus rhythm has replaced atrial \nfibrillation.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old F with history of AIDS (last CD4 count 6), ESRD on \nHD, herpes zoster ophthalmicus c/b post-herpetic neuralgia \npresenting with worsening right facial pain with blurry vision, \ndizziness, and hypotension.\n\n# Hypotension and dizziness: She was initially admitted to the \nICU with relative hypotension (baseline SBPs ___ and \ntachycardia with leukopenia, thereby meeting SIRS criteria. \nSince it was unclear if her hypotension was secondary to a \nseptic process, she was covered broadly with Vancomycin and \nCefepime to cover a ?line infection vs. CNS infection and \nacyclovir to prophylactically cover a reactivation of herpes \nzoster of her face.  She seemed to respond to 3L NS, maintaining \nSBPs in low ___, with occasional dips into the ___ without \nsymptoms.  Given her eosinophilia, her cortisol level was \nchecked to rule out adrenal insufficiency and it was low/normal. \nSubsequent stim test showed no adrenal disease.  She was seen by \nthe Renal team and it was decided to stop all antibiotics given \nthat her BPs were close to her baseline.  It was felt that her \nincreased dose of gabapention may have contributed to her \nfeeling unwell.  She was then transferred to the medical floor. \nBP's were stable on the floor, but dropped to 60's-70's systolic \nwhile on dialysis. Patient was asymptomatic and BP's recovered \nwith 200cc NS bolus. Patient was discharged with normal baseline \nsystolic BP in 80's-90's.\n\n# Headache with facial itching and blurry vision/Post-herpetic \nNeuralgia: She presented with an acute on chronic headache with \nacute worsening in the setting of discontinuation of gabapentin. \nAlthough there was a negative fluorescein exam in the ED, we \nalso asked the Ophthalmology team to evaluate her vision given \nher prior history of eye involvement.  They did not feel that \nthere were any acute concerns.  Patient was prescribed \nfexofenadine for her prurtitis. She also has a presumed \ndiagnosis of post-herpetic neuralgia. She was represcribed \namytriptiline which she reported has worked for her in the past.\n\n# Rash: Clinically suspicious for eosinophilic folliculiits in \nsetting of HIV. No vesicular lesions noted, without concern for \ndisseminated herpes zoster. Primarily has post inflammatory \nhyperpigmentation to trunk and extremities, although ? some \nactive lesions on scalp. Given proximity to facial lesions, with \n? herpes zoster reactivation, her pruritus was managed with \nfexofenadine 180mg qam, downtitrated to 60mg BID on transfer to \nthe floor. She was discharged with a prescription for this dose.\n\n# ESRD on dialysis: ESRD ___ HIV on ___ dialysis. She was \ncontinued on sevalemer and cinacalcet.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: She had one episode of afib during fluid \nbolus in ED.  Continued management with ASA 325mg daily, without \nrate controllers.\n\n# AIDS: CD4 count of 6, off HAART in setting of non compliance. \nHer risk for increased frequency herpes zoster reactivation off \nHAART is certainly elevated. She had stopped her TMP-SMX and \nazithromycin prophylaxis, so we restarted it on admission. She \nwas given Rx for these meds at discharge.\n\nTransitional Issues\n-The patient has ___ appointments with her PMD Dr ___ \nDermatology.\n-She will also continue her prior dialysis schedule of ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from webOMR.\n1.

This was \nlikely from your chronic shingles infection at your R eye. After \ncareful examination, it did not appear that you had an \ninfection. You also had significant itchiness that we have \ncontrolled with a medication called fexofenadine. You have been \nrestarted on a medication called amitryptiline to help you with \nyour eye pain.\n\nYour CD4 count was rechecked in the hospital. The level is 6. \nThis is dangerously low and puts you at risk for \nlife-threatening infection. This could be improved if you decide \nto start anti-retroviral therapy. There are antibiotic \nmedication that you can take to help prevent these infections \ncalled Bactrim and Azithromycin. You have started these \nmedications while you were in the hospital. You should continue \nto take these medications at home.\n\nYou have follow-up appointments with all of your doctors listed \nbelow. \n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you, Ms ___.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",
